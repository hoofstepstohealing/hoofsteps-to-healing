    <section>
        <h3>What is <em>Equine Facilitated Psychotherapy</em> (EFP)?</h3>
        <p>Equine Facilitated Psychotherapy (EFP) is a unique therapeutic approach that incorporates horses into the therapy process. It's a collaborative experience between a therapist, a horse, and the client, designed to promote emotional growth and healing through interaction with horses.</p>
        <p>It involves human-horse interactions, and these interactions often mirror internal emotional states and relational patterns. As herd animals, horses are powerful communicators using energy and non-verbal cues. This can take the emphasis off the spoken word, as traditional talking therapies tend to do, and onto emotional and somatic based experiences. Sessions happen outside in nature, providing a sensory rich experience.</p>
        <p>Horses are wonderful in the field of psychotherapy as they do not judge. They take you as you are. This helps to create relational safety and freedom to discover and experience a truly authentic self. In EFP, horses are equal partners in terms of facilitating sessions.</p>
        <p>A range of issues can be explored and are not limited to the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Anxiety</li>
            <li>Low mood</li>
            <li>Trauma</li>
            <li>Self-esteem</li>
            <li>Identity</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I am currently taking self-referrals from clients aged 18 years old and older.</p>

        <h3>How does EFP differ to Equine Facilitated Learning (EFL)?</h3>
        <p>EFP is practiced by a mental health professional and focuses on emotional growth, healing, and therapeutic goals. EFL, on the other hand, is facilitated by various professionals and focuses on self-development and education using equine interactions.</p>
