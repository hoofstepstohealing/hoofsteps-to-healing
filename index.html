            <h3>What is <em>Equine Facilitated Psychotherapy</em> (EFP)?</h3>
            <p>Equine Facilitated Psychotherapy (EFP) is a unique therapeutic approach that incorporates horses into the therapy process. It offers a collaborative experience between the therapist, the horse, and the client—designed to promote emotional healing through connection, presence, and compassion.</p>
            <p>Horses communicate primarily through body language and energy. Their sensitivity to human emotion helps mirror internal states and patterns, supporting deep, somatic healing. Sessions take place in nature and focus on experience over explanation.</p>
            <p>EFP encourages authenticity. Horses do not judge—they respond to how we feel, not how we appear. This provides a foundation of safety and emotional freedom in which to heal.</p>
            <p>Common areas explored in therapy include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Anxiety</li>
                <li>Low mood</li>
                <li>Trauma</li>
                <li>Self-esteem</li>
                <li>Identity</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Currently welcoming self-referrals for individuals aged 18 and over.</p>

            <h3>How is EFP different from Equine Facilitated Learning (EFL)?</h3>
            <p>While EFP is delivered by a qualified mental health professional and focuses on therapeutic goals, EFL is typically facilitated by educators or coaches and focuses on personal development, leadership, and learning. Both use the healing presence of horses—EFP, however, holds a deeper clinical framework.</p>
